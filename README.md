# Valentine's Day Website 💕

A romantic Angular website with two interactive pages to ask that special question!

## Features

- **Question Page**: Interactive "Will you be my girlfriend?" page with:
  - Evasive "No" button that moves away from mouse/touch
  - "Yes" button that grows bigger with each "No" attempt
  - Beautiful heart animations

- **Success Page**: Celebration page with:
  - Romantic photo display
  - Music player with play/pause controls
  - Floating hearts and confetti animations
  - Modern, romantic design

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Add your custom content:
   - Place your music file in `src/assets/music/love-song.mp3`
   - Place your photo in `src/assets/images/couple-photo.jpg`

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`

## Build for Production

```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Customization

- **Message**: Edit the text in the component files to personalize the message

## Technologies Used
